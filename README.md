# Stock Price Prediction

Challenges:
Predicting stock prices over time is a complex challenge due to the inherent volatility and uncertainty in financial markets. Stock prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, including market trends, economic indicators, news, and investor sentiment, making accurate forecasting difficult. Additionally, the non-linear and time-dependent nature of stock data further complicates the task.

Methodology:
In this project, I employed both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning models using TensorFlow to forecast stock prices. Initially, I explored traditional techniques such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to capture relationships between historical price data and other market features. For more complex patterns and better generalization, I leveraged TensorFlow to build deep learning models, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), which are well-suited for time series forecasting tasks.

Key Achievements:
The model achieved notable results with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the range of 0.10 to 0.15, demonstrating the ability to forecast stock price movements with reasonable accuracy over time. Despite the challenges presented by market volatility, the deep learning model outperformed traditional machine learning algorithms in capturing temporal dependencies, leading to improved predictions.

This repo provides insights into the potential of combining traditional ML methods with deep learning for stock price forecasting, offering valuable tools for market analysts and investors seeking to make data-driven decisions.
